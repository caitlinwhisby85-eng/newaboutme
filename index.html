    <p> Hi, my name is Caitlin Whisby and I'm a first semester student at the Craig Newmark school. I moved to New York from Atlanta and I currently live in BedStuy. I am interested in learning more about audio and reporting on arts and culture. One of my favorite podcasts is Snap Judgement.

    <h3> These are my top 3 journalism stories </h3>
    <ol>
    <li><p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/magazine/oysters-a-love-story.html">Oysters: A Love Story</a> - I love this story. My sister showed it to me years ago because we both used to love going out to eat oysters. We would go to happy hours at various restaurants and stuff our faces with dozen oyster deals. I'm vegetarian now, but the story still moves me.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p> <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/musician-willow-smith-on-empathy-as-the-seed-for-creativity/">The Creative Independent's Interview with Willow Smith</a> - I like reading any interview that Willow Smith does. She is my favorite artist of all time. I find her very interesting.</p>
    </li>
   <li><p> <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/meet-the-queen-of-the-trad-wives-and-her-eight-children-plfr50cgk">Meet the queen of the trad wives and her eight children</a> - I think that this interview is so fascinating It gives me an inside look in Hannah and makes you question if she wants the life that she currently lives.</p>
